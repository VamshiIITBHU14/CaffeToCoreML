# CaffeToCoreML
Hey'll!
There are a lot of tutorials/ open source projects on how to use Vision and CoreML frameworks for object detection in real world 
using .mlmodels given by Apple. But seldom in reality, do we get a .mlmodel available suiting our use case. CAFFE is one of the
most famous Deep Learning frameworks used to train ML models (more details here: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org)
